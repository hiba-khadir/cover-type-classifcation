# Forest Covertype Classification (Machine Learning)

This project is a comparative analysis of preformance of different models on the **Forest Covertype** multi-class classification problem.

It includes:

* Data exploration and statistical analysis
* Feature inspection and visualization
* Different preprocessing pipelines for each model 
* Model training and evaluation
* Comparative performance conclusions
